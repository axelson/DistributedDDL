How to install DB2 on Ubuntu and the IBM_DB python egg.

Download DB2 as an Ubuntu .deb file here for your ARCH

ftp.software.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/latest_debs

Run: sudo gdebi-gtk db2exc_*.deb

This will bring up the synaptic package manager to install DB2

Once complete you’ll have more users in /home, you’ll now need to export these locations to your ENV
(Paste these as they appear)

$ . /home/db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile
$ export IBM_DB_DIR=/home/db2inst1/sqllib
$ export IBM_DB_LIB=/home/db2inst1/sqllib/lib
(Note: Once you close your terminal, the last two export commands will no longer be in your session, to keep this persistent, paste the export lines into your .bashrc.

Now your DB2 libraries are setup, if you wish to continue installing locally see: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/DB2-HOWTO/ubuntu704.html
However, if you only wish to connect to a remote database you may skip the above step.

Make sure you have python-dev installed:

sudo apt-get install python-dev

Make sure you have python setuptools installed (so we can easily install ibm_db for python)

sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

Install ibm_db: ( egg/docs/source also located here if you don’t want to use setuptools: http://code.google.com/p/ibm-db/ )

sudo easy_install ibm_db

Ignore the warnings when you install, this is normal. If you have warnings about your ENV’s not setup, make sure you have exported them in the above step.

Open up a python prompt and import ibm_db

$ python
